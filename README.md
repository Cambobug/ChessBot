3700 Assignment 2 - Cameron Fraser

In order to run the program you must navigate to the directory that the programs are in then in the terminal you need to run the command "python pawnstars.py". After running that command, the program will prompt you for an input of 1 or 2, if you choose "1" you will play against a bot and it will prompt you to choose your colour. If you choose "2" you will play against yourself and the board will orient itself based on the turn of the player.

If you are playing against a bot the program will prompt you to choose the colour you would like to play, "White" or "Black". If you choose white you will make the first move, if you choose black the AI will make the first move.

To make a move, enter the coordinate of the piece you wish to move, followed by a space and then the coordinates you wish to move the selected piece too (Ex. C1 C4). After making a move, the AI will take a moment to decide upon its next move, once it decides it will make the move and print the board for you to make your next move.

CASTLING: In order to initiate a castle, you must type the Kings position followed by the Rooks position that you wish to castle with, Ex. E1 H1

P.S. If you would like to see something fun, when prompted to enter the number of players, enter "0". You can sit back and watch the AI vs itself.
